### **MODELLER: Design and Organization of the Workflow**

The design of this workflow builds upon well-established methodologies in homology modeling, adapting them to create a fully automated, scalable, and user-friendly pipeline. While the structure was inspired by the **MODELLER tutorial** ([source](https://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html)), the workflow was reimagined to suit modern computational needs, focusing on efficiency, flexibility, and automation.

Additionally, inspiration was drawn from the GitHub repository **An Automated Pipeline for Homology Modeling** ([source](https://github.com/HongYhong/An-automated-pipeline-for-homology-modeling/tree/main)), which provided valuable insights into real-world implementation of automated modeling pipelines. This foundation was extended and customized to meet the unique challenges and requirements of this project.

#### **Our Workflow Design Philosophy**

1. **Modularity**:
    - Drawing from the MODELLER tutorial, we structured the pipeline into distinct, logical sections:
        - File preparation and validation.
        - Template selection and alignment.
        - Model generation and refinement.
        - Output organization and post-processing.
    - Each section operates independently, ensuring the pipeline is easy to debug, extend, and adapt to different datasets.
2. **Automation and Scalability**:
    - Inspired by the GitHub repository, we prioritized automating repetitive tasks, such as:
        - Splitting and processing multi-chain FASTA files.
        - Downloading and cleaning templates.
        - Running MODELLER scripts for alignment and model generation.
    - This automation ensures the workflow scales efficiently to handle large datasets.
3. **Enhanced Features**:
    - To go beyond the traditional tutorial approach, we integrated:
        - **Rotamer sampling** using SCWRL4 to refine side-chain conformations.
        - **Error handling** at every step to ensure graceful recovery from issues like missing templates or failed alignments.
        - **Dynamic directory organization** to keep outputs tidy and traceable.
4. **Practicality for Users**:
    - We optimized the workflow for real-world computational environments by:
        - Using lightweight, dynamically downloaded databases like `pdb_95.pir`.
        - Organizing outputs into well-structured directories for each FASTA file or chain.
        - Ensuring compatibility with cloud environments and resource-constrained systems.
#### **Why We Chose These Resources**
- **MODELLER Tutorial**:
    - Provided the theoretical framework and step-by-step approach for homology modeling.
    - Helped us establish a logical division of tasks within the workflow.
- **GitHub Repository**:
    - Showcased practical implementations of automation in homology modeling.
    - Inspired enhancements such as dynamic output organization and multi-tool integration.
#### **How We Made It Our Own**

By integrating the structured methodology outlined in the MODELLER tutorial with practical automation strategies from the referenced GitHub repository, we developed a workflow that is precisely tailored to the requirements of this project. It is robust enough to handle edge cases, scalable for high-throughput protein structure predictions, and accessible for researchers with varying levels of computational expertise.

The original MODELLER workflow was not fully optimized for automation, requiring manual steps such as downloading and fixing PDB templates. Additionally, it lacked enhancements like rotamer sampling to refine predicted structures. Meanwhile, the GitHub repository provided a solid foundation but was limited to processing Uniprot sequences, restricting its broader applicability.

Our approach addresses these shortcomings by transforming the workflow into a modern, fully automated solution. It eliminates the inefficiencies of manual and semi-automated processes, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and adaptability for diverse input types and research needs.

### **Why Split Multi-Chain FASTA Files?** 

MODELLER requires input files to be in the `.ali` format, which has a strict structure and specific requirements for alignment and sequence information. Splitting multi-chain FASTA files into individual chains is a crucial step for ensuring compatibility with MODELLER and preserving biological relevance.

#### **Key Requirements from MODELLER**

1. **Single Chain per File**:
    - **Why**: In `.ali` format, each file can only contain one sequence. This restriction ensures that MODELLER can map the target sequence to its template without ambiguity.
    - **Impact of Multi-Chain Files**: Merging chains into a single sequence would distort their biological integrity, as each chain often represents a distinct functional subunit or interaction partner.
    
1. **Proper Sequence Formatting**:
    - **Why**: MODELLER uses sequence alignments to guide homology modeling. Improperly formatted sequences or multiple chains in one file can lead to misaligned templates or failed predictions.
    - **From the Tutorial** ([source](https://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html)):
        > **“MODELLER uses a specific alignment format (.ali) to define the relationship between the target sequence and the template. The sequence must be clean, well-defined, and formatted to avoid alignment errors.”
        
3. **Preservation of Original Identifiers**:
    - **Why**: The original name of the sequence (e.g., RCSB `4ABC_1` or Uniprot `P12345`) is critical for:
        - Ensuring traceability in the pipeline.
        - Using the correct template for each chain in downstream steps.
        - Maintaining clarity when interpreting outputs or debugging errors.
    - **From the Tutorial**:
        > **“Each alignment and its corresponding sequence should retain identifiers that link it back to the original data source, ensuring clarity and reproducibility.”
---
### **How We Split Multi-Chain FASTA Files**

The `split.sh` script automates this preprocessing step by splitting multi-chain FASTA files into individual chains, renaming them for clarity, and preparing them for further processing.
#### **Step-by-Step Workflow of `split.sh`**
1. **Input Validation**:
    - Ensures the input file follows the CHAR_num style (e.g., `>4ABC_1`) required for structural modeling - because Uniprot files are usually in a single sequence format. CHAR_num files often represent multi-chain structures, which must be processed separately.
    - Skips invalid files to prevent downstream errors:
    ```bash
    if ! grep -Eq '^>[^[:space:]]{4}_[0-9]+' "$id"; then
        echo "Skipping '$id': Not a valid PDB-formatted file (4CHAR_1 format required)."
        exit 0
    fi
    ```
        
2. **Splitting by Chain**:
    - Separates the multi-chain FASTA file into individual sequences using the `>` delimiter:
    ```bash
    csplit -s "$id" '/>/' '{*}' || { echo "Error: csplit failed."; exit 1; }
    ```
    - This ensures that each chain is processed independently.
3. **Extracting Original Identifiers**:
    - Extracts identifiers (e.g., `4ABC_1` or `P12345`) from the headers for traceability and clarity:
    ```bash
    grep ">" xx* | sed -E 's/^.*>([^|[:space:]]+).*/\1/' > namelist
    ```
        
4. **Renaming Files**:
    - Renames each split file using its extracted identifier to maintain a clear link to the original data source:
        ```bash
        paste origlist namelist | tr [:blank:] "," > renamelist
        while IFS=',' read orig target; do
            sanitized_name=$(echo "$target" | tr -d '[:space:]')  # Remove spaces
            mv "$orig" "${sanitized_name}.fasta" || { echo "Error renaming $orig to $sanitized_name.fasta"; exit 1; }
        done < renamelist
        ```
        
5. **Cleanup**:
    - Removes the original file and intermediate files to keep the directory clean:
        ```bash
        rm -f "$id"
        rm renamelist
        ```
        
6. **Integration with Subsequent Scripts**:
    
    - The renamed files (e.g., `4ABC_1.fasta`) serve as inputs for downstream scripts like `convert_fasta.sh` and `build_profile.py`. This standardized naming convention ensures:
        - Easy identification of sequences.
        - Seamless integration with the rest of the workflow.

---
### **Why This Approach Is Effective**
1. **Preserves Biological Context**:
    - By keeping chains separate and using their original identifiers, the workflow ensures that the structural and functional roles of each chain are not compromised.
2. **Facilitates MODELLER Compatibility**:
    - Outputs single-chain FASTA files in a format ready for conversion to `.ali`, meeting MODELLER’s stringent input requirements.
3. **Maintains Traceability**:
    - Retains the original identifiers (e.g., `4ABC_1` or `P12345`) throughout the workflow, ensuring clarity in outputs and reproducibility in results.
4. **Automation and Scalability**:
    - Eliminates the need for manual splitting and renaming, making the workflow efficient and scalable for large datasets.

---
### **Conclusion**

The `split.sh` script is a critical component of the workflow, bridging the gap between raw input data and the stringent requirements of MODELLER. By automating the splitting and renaming process, it ensures that each chain is treated independently, preserving its biological and functional relevance while maintaining compatibility with subsequent modeling steps. This design reflects best practices outlined in the MODELLER tutorial and is further enhanced by our emphasis on automation and clarity.

---

    - Improves efficiency and speeds up template ranking.
#### **3. Compatibility with MODELLER**
- The database is in `.pir` format, a structure-compatible sequence alignment format that MODELLER directly supports for template searching and ranking.

---
### **Why We Chose SCWRL4 for Rotamer Sampling**

#### **1. Refinement of Side-Chain Conformations**

- **From the MODELLER Tutorial**:
    > **"The predicted structure often requires further refinement, especially in regions of uncertainty, such as side chains."
- **Why SCWRL4**:
    - SCWRL4 is a specialized tool designed for **rotamer sampling**, focusing on optimizing side-chain conformations.
    - It uses an energy-based approach, minimizing steric clashes and improving the physical plausibility of the model.
#### **2. Enhancement of Model Quality**

- MODELLER generates high-quality backbone and side-chain placements but does not optimize rotamers for all residues.
- SCWRL4 refines these placements by:
    - Reducing steric clashes.
    - Achieving more realistic geometry for side chains.
- This results in a final structure that is suitable for downstream applications like docking or dynamics simulations.
#### **3. Lightweight and Efficient**
- SCWRL4 is computationally efficient and lightweight, making it an excellent choice for refining large datasets without significant computational overhead.
#### **4. Alignment with Project Requirements**

---

### **How They Fit into the Workflow**
1. **Template Selection with `pdb_95.pir`**:
    - The workflow uses `build_profile.py` to search for templates in `pdb_95.pir`.
    - Templates are ranked based on sequence similarity and structural quality.
    - The best template is selected and processed for alignment and model generation.
2. **Rotamer Sampling with SCWRL4**:
    - After the best model is selected (based on GA341 and DOPE scores), SCWRL4 is applied for rotamer sampling.
    - The command:
    ```bash
    scwrl4/Scwrl4 -i "$best_model" -o "${base_name}_final.pdb"
    ```
	refines the selected model and outputs a structure with optimized side-chain conformations.

---
### **Conclusion**
The choice of `pdb_95.pir` and SCWRL4 ensures the workflow achieves a balance between computational efficiency and structural accuracy:
- **`pdb_95.pir`** simplifies template selection by focusing on high-quality, non-redundant structures, ensuring the best starting point for modeling.
- **SCWRL4** refines the final model by optimizing side-chain geometry, enhancing the structure's realism and usability for downstream tasks.

This combination reflects best practices in homology modeling, as outlined in the MODELLER tutorial, and aligns with industry standards for protein structure prediction workflows.

---
### **Template Ranking and Selection**

The `build_profile.prf` file is a critical output of the `build_profile.py` script, which identifies and ranks suitable templates for homology modeling based on sequence similarity and structural quality. This file is parsed and analyzed in the workflow to select the best template.
#### **Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Analyzing the `build_profile.prf` File**:
    - The `.prf` file contains essential information about the alignment between the target sequence and potential templates from the `pdb_95.pir` database.
    - Each line in the `.prf` file corresponds to a potential template and includes fields such as:
        - **Template Name**: Identifier of the template structure.
        - **Sequence Identity**: The percentage similarity between the target sequence and the template.
        - **Coverage**: The extent to which the template covers the target sequence.
        - **E-Value**: Statistical measure of the template's relevance.
        - **Alignment Score**: A composite metric indicating the quality of the alignment.
    - **From the Tutorial** ([source](https://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html)):
        >**"The .prf file provides a summary of potential templates and their alignment scores. Templates with higher sequence identity and better coverage are generally preferred for accurate modeling."
        
2. **Ranking Templates**:
    - The workflow filters and ranks templates using the following logic:
        ```bash
        cat build_profile.prf | grep -v "^#" | awk '{print $1 "\t" $2 "\t" $11}' | awk '!$3==0' | sort -k3nr > log_file.log
        ```
        
        - **Filter Out Comments**: Removes lines starting with `#` to focus on template data.
        - **Extract Key Columns**:
            - `$1`: Template name.
            - `$2`: Sequence identity or similarity.
            - `$11`: Alignment score.
        - **Exclude Irrelevant Templates**: Templates with an alignment score of `0` are ignored.
        - **Sort by Score**: Templates are ranked in descending order based on their alignment score, prioritizing those with the best fit.
3. **Choosing the Best Template**:
    - The best template is selected as the first entry in the ranked log file:
        ```bash
        best_template=$(awk 'NR==1 {print $2}' log_file.log)
        ```
        - **Why This Matters**: The top-ranked template typically has the highest sequence similarity and alignment score, ensuring the most reliable starting point for homology modeling.
    - If no suitable template is found, the script gracefully skips further processing for the current sequence.
4. **Logging the Selected Template**:
    - The best template’s identifier is stored in `template.txt` for traceability:
        ```bash
        echo "$best_template" > template.txt
        ```
---
### **How This Step Fits the Workflow**
1. **Critical Role of the `.prf` File**:
    - The `.prf` file bridges the gap between the sequence data and structural templates by summarizing potential matches and their alignment quality.
2. **Automated Template Selection**:
    - By automating the ranking and selection process, the workflow eliminates manual decision-making, ensuring scalability for large datasets.
3. **Ensuring Accuracy**:
    - Templates with higher sequence similarity and alignment scores provide more accurate structural models, directly impacting the quality of downstream modeling.
---
### **Why It Matters**

    - The script takes the `tobefixed.pdb` file generated by the `download.py` script and loads it using PDBFixer:
        ```python
        fixer = PDBFixer(filename=input_pdb)
        ```
2. **Step-by-Step Cleaning Process**:
    
    - **Detect and Fix Missing Residues**:
        - Identifies gaps in the structure and adds missing residues where possible, ensuring a complete backbone.
    - **Replace Non-Standard Residues**:
        - Detects and replaces residues that deviate from standard amino acids, resolving potential conflicts with modeling tools.
    - **Add Missing Atoms**:
        - Fills in incomplete side chains by adding missing atoms based on residue templates.
    - **Add Hydrogens**:
        - Adds hydrogens to achieve a neutral pH structure, which is critical for structural refinement and dynamics.
3. **Output a Cleaned PDB File**:
    - The cleaned structure is saved as `{PDB_ID}.pdb`, ensuring compatibility with subsequent alignment and modeling steps.
4. **Analysis Report**:
	- The script generates a detailed `analysis_report_template.txt` file documenting:
	    - Missing residues or atoms fixed.
	    - Non-standard residues replaced.
	    - Hydrogens added.
	- This report provides traceability and insight into the modifications applied to the template.
